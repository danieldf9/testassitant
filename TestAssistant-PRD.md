# Product Requirements Document: Test Assistant

## 1. Overview

**Test Assistant** is an AI-powered productivity tool designed to augment Jira workflows for software development and QA teams. It connects directly to a user's Jira instance to automate the creation of test cases, draft detailed bug reports, generate automated test code, and build entire project backlogs from requirement documents. The primary goal is to accelerate development cycles, improve the quality of test and bug documentation, and reduce the manual effort involved in project management.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. Jira Integration & Authentication
- **Objective**: Securely connect to a user's Jira instance to read project/issue data and write new issues/attachments.
- **Requirements**:
    - Users must authenticate using their Jira Instance URL, login email, and a personal API Token.
    - Credentials must be stored securely in the browser's local storage for session persistence.
    - The application must provide a "Disconnect" option to clear stored credentials.
    - The application must gracefully handle authentication failures (e.g., incorrect URL, invalid token, network issues) and provide clear, user-friendly error messages.

### 2.2. Project and Issue Management
- **Objective**: Allow users to browse and find Jira issues within a selected project.
- **Requirements**:
    - After authentication, the user must be able to select from a list of their accessible Jira projects.
    - Upon project selection, the application must display a paginated list of issues from that project.
    - The issue list must display key information: Issue Key, Summary, Issue Type, and Status.
    - Users must be able to perform a keyword search to filter issues within the selected project.

### 2.3. AI-Powered Test Case Generation
- **Objective**: Automate the creation of detailed test cases from an existing Jira issue.
- **Requirements**:
    - From the issue list, a user can select an action to generate test cases for a specific issue.
    - The application will use an AI flow, providing it with the issue's summary, description, and acceptance criteria.
    - The AI will generate a comprehensive set of test cases, including:
        - A unique Test Case ID (e.g., `[PROJECT_KEY]-TEST-001`).
        - A descriptive name, precondition, ordered test steps, and an expected result.
    - The generated test cases must be displayed to the user in a clear, tabular format for review.
    - The user must have the option to attach the generated test cases to the original Jira issue as a formatted Excel (`.xlsx`) file.

### 2.4. AI-Assisted Bug Reporting
- **Objective**: Streamline the process of creating high-quality, well-structured bug reports in Jira.
- **Requirements**:
    - Users can open a "Raise Bug" modal for the currently selected project.
    - The user provides a free-form description of the bug, selects an environment (e.g., QA, PROD), and can optionally attach a file.
    - The application sends this information to an AI flow to draft a formal bug report.
    - The AI-drafted report must include:
        - A concise summary prefixed with "Bug: ".
        - A structured markdown description with sections for "Environment", "Issue Description", "Steps to Reproduce", "Expected Result", and "Actual Result".
    - The user can preview the AI-drafted bug report before creation.
    - Upon confirmation, the application creates the bug ticket in Jira with the generated details and adds the attachment if provided.
    - The application should offer to save and load bug report drafts from local storage to reuse common information.

### 2.5. Automated Test Code Generation (Playwright)
- **Objective**: Generate initial test automation code based on a Jira issue, following best practices.
- **Requirements**:
    - The application must provide a dedicated page for generating Playwright test code.
    - A "Setup" area must allow users to configure project-specific settings for code generation:
        - Application Base URL.
        - A description of the authentication flow.
        - A list of common UI selectors.
        - Boilerplate code (e.g., imports, `beforeEach` hooks).
    - From the issue list on the generator page, a user can initiate code generation.
    - The system will first generate test cases (as in 2.3) and then feed those test cases and the project setup to a second AI flow.
    - The AI will generate a complete Playwright test file (`.spec.ts`) in TypeScript, structured using the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern.
    - The generated code and the intermediate test cases will be displayed to the user for review and copying.

### 2.6. Document-to-Backlog Generation
- **Objective**: Analyze a high-level requirements document (PDF) and automatically generate a structured project backlog in Jira.
- **Requirements**:
    - The application must feature a "Document Importer" page.
    - The user can upload a PDF requirements document.
    - The user can provide optional AI hints, such as target user personas or desired output format.
    - An AI flow will analyze the document and draft a hierarchical structure of Jira tickets (Epics, Stories, Tasks, Sub-tasks).
    - The AI must generate comprehensive descriptions and acceptance criteria for each ticket, embedding the criteria within the description field.
    - The drafted ticket hierarchy must be displayed in an editable tree view where the user can modify summaries, descriptions, and ticket types, or delete tickets.
    - Upon confirmation, the system will create all tickets in Jira, correctly establishing the parent-child relationships (e.g., Sub-tasks linked to Stories, Stories linked to Epics).

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **UI/UX**: The application will use a clean, modern, and responsive design built with ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS. The color scheme is based on soft blues and violets to create a calm and productive feel.
- **Performance**: API calls should be efficient, and the UI should feel responsive. Loading states must be used for all asynchronous operations.
- **Error Handling**: All interactions with the Jira API or AI services must have robust error handling to provide clear feedback to the user.
- **Technology Stack**: The application is a Next.js web app, using React for the frontend, Genkit for AI flows, and TypeScript.
